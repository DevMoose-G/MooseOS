# MooseOS
## Current OS Plan:
- Underlying OS on a console
- Connects to phones through an app on the OS
- Only Physical Input is a knob to scroll through options (ie Games, Store, Media) and a button on top to select that option
- Focuses on casual gaming where people can use their phone to play games with each other
- Basic UI: Wheel of Options that you use the knob to scroll through
